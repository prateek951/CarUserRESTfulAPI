# CarUserRESTfulAPI
This is a simple RESTful API that implements HTTP verbs like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE and PATCH.For improving authentication and authorization, used the Helmet module. 
``` Restful api demonstrate one to many associations of the user and the car.  ```
JS code in ES6 has been implemented using three ways and I have demonstrated each and every way in my code
  1. Callbacks
  2. Promises
  3. Async Await (which is the way we make our otherwise asynchronous code work in synchronous manner)
